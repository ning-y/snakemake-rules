A repository of Snakemake rules.

* Why not wrappers?

I think each workflow should be as self-contained as possible.
Using wrappers introduces an additional dependency which may break, hindering the reproducibility of your pipeline.
Plus, wrappers can be annoying to debug, since their body usually exists in some other file.

* Conventions in this repository

- Prefer named input/outputs :: The introduction of new input/outputs will often break shell/run directives if they depend on "positional" input/outputs.
- Underscore names :: Underscore-prefixed names are implementation details which can be ignored.
  For example, underscore-prefixed rules might download example data for testing; underscore-prefixed parameters might be automatically generated from the un-underscore-prefixed input/output/params values.
